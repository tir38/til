# Brain Dump

## Good Habits
*I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits.* - Kent Beck

There are some things that I regularly need to come back to and refresh myself on.

### Software Dev Soft Skills

* [Instagram Design Philosophy](https://instagram-engineering.com/instagram-android-four-years-later-927c166b0201)

>Almost all complex business logic happens server-side, where it is easier to fix bugs and add new features. We rely on the server to be perfect, enforced through continuous integration testing, and dispense with null-checking or data-consistency checking on the client. Because of this, the app crashes when there is malformed data, rather than remain in a weird state. Our automated crash reporting triggers alarms and an investigation, and we can fix the bug. It is much easier to fix a crash, with an attached stack trace, than to debug a weird state issue based on a userâ€™s report.


## Today I Learned:

A running list of things that I've learned or had to re-learn. Lately I've been doing more [reading](READ_LIST.md) than learning individual tricks:

* **05/30/2018** You can define RecyclerView's LayoutManager in xml [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35680716)

* **10/11/2017** If we set `START_STICKY` then system will restart service when resources are available (which means immediatly if user force kills app). Read more [here](https://stackoverflow.com/q/15452935)

* **8/27/2017** We can make Observables blocking with `toBlocking()` for RxJava1 and `forBlockingX()` for RxJava2. Read more [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28081821/rxjava-how-to-set-observer-to-block).

* **8/7/2017** `protected` fields are still exposed to entire package. i.e. `package private` is *more* restrictive than `protected`. How did I not know this?

* **5/17/2017** You don't need to do math on Window height/width to determine orientation. Just `getResources().getConfiguration().orientation`. [read more](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html#orientation)

* **2/10/2017** RecyclerView has a `smoothScrollToPosition` in addition to `scrollToPosition`

* **12/7/2016** RxJava has a `distinct` and `distinctUntilChanged` operators that won't emit duplicate items [read more](http://rxmarbles.com/#distinctUntilChanged)

* **11/7/2016** Junit4's `@BeforeClass` and `@AfterClass` methods have to be `static`. [read more](http://selftechy.com/2011/05/17/junit4-before-vs-beforeclass-after-vs-afterclass)

* **10/13/2016** Views can dump out a bitmap version of themselves by "hijacking" the existing draw(Canvas method) method. This method is normally used by parent views to draw a view by providing a canvas for the view. Instead we supply our own Canvas that has an empty (but properly sized) Bitmap. This bitmap will then be used by the view to draw a pixelated version of itself. Read more [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3036736).

* **9/6/2016** Using Dagger, we don't *have* to use the module to provide all sub-dependencies. We can just use `@Binds` (instead of `@Provides`) [read more](https://medium.com/android-news/inject-interfaces-without-providing-in-dagger-2-618cce9b1e29#.ozol1agh5)

* **9/2/2016** FragmentTransactions can be committed after onSavedInstanceState if you are willing to lose state when activity is killed via [commitAllowingStateLoss( )](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/FragmentTransaction.html#commitAllowingStateLoss(%29)

* **8/9/2016** That size and capacity are different in array lists [details](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8896758/initial-size-for-the-arraylist)

* **7/11/2016** When specifying url in intent filter, scheme is mandatory *"If a scheme is not specified for the intent filter, all the other URI attributes are ignored."* [docs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/data-element.html#scheme)

* **7/7/2016** [`PhoneNumberFormattingTextWatcher`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/PhoneNumberFormattingTextWatcher.html) is a thing.

* **7/5/2016** The default interpolator on `ObjectAnimator` is ` AccelerateDecelerateInterpolator` not (as I expected) `LinearInterpolator`. This results in really janky animation when repeating.

* **6/17/2016** Travis will not supply secret env vars for builds coming from pull requests from upstream forks. This means that if other people create a pull request against your repository, they can't see your secret env vars. [read more](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/pull-requests#Security-Restrictions-when-testing-Pull-Requests)

* **6/9/2016** In Android Studio when refactoring code out into new method, it will detect other occurrences of that code and replace with new method call.

* **5/19/2016** Rx's Obervable.subscribe() has overload for multiple functions. This means that you don't have to pass in an Observer which implements three methods (onNext, onError, and onComplete). By passing in a three-method object, you can't lambda-ify. However with the overloaded subscribe() method, it takes in single-method objects (i.e. function objects) as parameters. [link](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/javadoc/rx/Observable.html#subscribe(rx.functions.Action1,%20rx.functions.Action1,%20rx.functions.Action0%29). This means you can lambda-ify.

* **5/16/2016** `TextUtils.join` for creating character-delimited strings; [link](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/TextUtils.html#join(java.lang.CharSequence, java.lang.Object[]))

* **5/10/2016** - TextView has `letterSpacing` attribute for custom kerning (on API 21+) [link](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html#attr_android:letterSpacing)

* **5/5/2016** - TextView support seamless shadows with `android:shadowColor`, `android:shadowDx`, `android:shadowDy`, and `android:shadowRadius`. [link](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html#attr_android:shadowColor)

* **5/4/2016** - `Stroke` has `dashGap` and `dashWidth` for making dashed line drawable shapes. [link](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/drawable-resource.html#stroke-element)

* **4/27/2016** sacrificial architecture [link](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SacrificialArchitecture.html). specifically this quote:

	>Indeed one of the best things to do with an early version of a system is to explore what the best modular structure should be so that you can build on that knowledge for the replacement

* **4/25/2016** `ellipsize="middle"` is an attribute/value on TextView that will automagically remove elements in the middle to ensure text fits [docs](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html#attr_android:ellipsize)

* **10/5/2015** Timber is awesome; always use it

* **9/8/2015**	InstantiationException is a thing: [link](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/InstantiationException.html)

* **8/24/2015**	in Android Studio we can see running threads in debug without having to use breakpoint with "Restore 'Threads' view"	

* **8/20/2015**	adjustResize vs adjustPan; [read more](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html)

* **7/31/2015**	GSON can serialize directly to/from enum; [read more](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9064433/gson-non-case-sensitive-enum-deserialization/18343576#18343576)

* **7/22/2015**	we can recreate back stack in pending intent [read more](http://stackoverflow.com/a/13294352)

* **6/9/2015**	LinearLayout.LayoutParams constructor takes in layout weight as a float, so we can specify layout weight as float in xml	[link](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/LinearLayout.LayoutParams.html#LinearLayout.LayoutParams(int, int, float%29)

* **5/15/2015**	 we can have our location request piggy back another request (and only get locations when another app requests a location) via the [PRIORITY_NO_POWER flag](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/LocationRequest.html#PRIORITY_NO_POWER)

* **5/15/2015**	we can set "uses feature" for location (and course and fine resolution)	[read more](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element.html#features-reference)

* **5/14/2015**	we can intercept recycler view's `onMeasure` to set custom span [link](http://blog.sqisland.com/2014/12/recyclerview-autofit-grid.html)

* **5/14/2015** 	I never knew *why* we set `attachToRoot` to be false inside layout inflater. Its because layout inflater doesn't' know that something else might handle attachment (e.g. a fragment). Read more [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12567640).
