## Good Habits
*I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits.* - Kent Beck

There are some things that I regularly need to come back to and refresh myself on.

### Software Dev Soft Skills

* [Proper Naming of Test Doubles](https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/14/TheLittleMocker.html)

* [Avoid Nested Mocks](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/blog/2014/test-isolation-is-about-avoiding-mocks)

### Style Guides
* [The best Android style guide](https://github.com/bufferapp/android-guidelines/blob/master/project_style_guidelines.md)

### Android Studio Tips
* [50 Android Studio tips](https://medium.com/@mmbialas/50-android-studio-tips-tricks-resources-you-should-be-familiar-with-as-an-android-developer-af86e7cf56d2#.zdg2tg99u)

### Crash Early; Crash Often
* [Why your app should crash](https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2017/03/08/appcrash/)
* [Instagram Design Philosophy](https://instagram-engineering.com/instagram-android-four-years-later-927c166b0201)

>Almost all complex business logic happens server-side, where it is easier to fix bugs and add new features. We rely on the server to be perfect, enforced through continuous integration testing, and dispense with null-checking or data-consistency checking on the client. Because of this, the app crashes when there is malformed data, rather than remain in a weird state. Our automated crash reporting triggers alarms and an investigation, and we can fix the bug. It is much easier to fix a crash, with an attached stack trace, than to debug a weird state issue based on a userâ€™s report.

* [Square's Crash Fast approach](https://vimeo.com/145042944)

### Design Patterns
* [Functional Core / Imperetive Shell](https://github.com/kbilsted/Functional-core-imperative-shell/blob/master/README.md)
