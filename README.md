## Good Habits

### Crash Early; Crash Often
* [Why your app should crash](https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2017/03/08/appcrash/)
* [Instagram Design Philosophy](https://instagram-engineering.com/instagram-android-four-years-later-927c166b0201)

>Almost all complex business logic happens server-side, where it is easier to fix bugs and add new features. We rely on the server to be perfect, enforced through continuous integration testing, and dispense with null-checking or data-consistency checking on the client. Because of this, the app crashes when there is malformed data, rather than remain in a weird state. Our automated crash reporting triggers alarms and an investigation, and we can fix the bug. It is much easier to fix a crash, with an attached stack trace, than to debug a weird state issue based on a userâ€™s report.
